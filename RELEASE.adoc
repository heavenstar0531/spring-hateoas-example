=== Making a release

1. Create a new release (on the main branch).
+
----
% ci/create-release.sh <release version> <next snapshot version>
----
+
2. With the release tagged, push the tagged version to the release branch.
+
----
% git checkout -b release
% git reset --hard <tag>
% git push -f origin release
----

NOTE: You can chain the previous set of commands together using `&&`.

The pipeline will build and release the "release" branch. It will also build a new a new snapshot and stage it on artifactory.
